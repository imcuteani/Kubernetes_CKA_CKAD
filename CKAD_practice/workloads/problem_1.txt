1. Create a deployment name nginx which uses the image nginx:1.17.0. Set two replicas to begin with. 

2. Scale the deployment to seven replicas using the scale command. Ensure the correct number of pods exist. 

3. Create a horizontal pod autoscalar named nginx-hpa for the deployment with an average utilization of CPU to 65% and an average utilization to memory to 1Gi. Set the minimum no of replicas 3 and maximum replicas to 20. 

4. Update the pod template of the deployment to use image nginx:1.21.1. Make sure the changes are recorded. Inspect the revision history. How many revisions should be rendered? Roll back to first revision. 

5. Create a new secret named basic-auth of type kubernetes.io/basic-auth. Assign the key-value pairs username=super and password=my-s8cr3t. Mount the secret as a volume with the path /etc/secret and read-only permission to the pods controlled by the deployment.
